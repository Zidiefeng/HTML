<p>I see you in my thoughts and dreams,
    When I awake, how real it seems.
    You aren’t here to comfort me,
    But soon I hope you will be.
    No one truly knows or understands;
    You have my heart in your hands.
    My love is what you truly own.
    Come soon and make our house a home.</p>

<p>Inside those walls you are doing your time,
    Not being here with me is your only true crime.
    Others in your life will come and go,
    But my love is true, and i’m sure you know.
</p>

<p>I may not be rich or the prettiest one,
    But I love you so much; you are my sun.
    You light up my life every time you call.
    When the time is up, I begin to fall.
    You are my stars, you are my moon,
    Being with you will come very soon.
    So when you sleep, take this to heart,
    No one or nothing will keep us apart.</p>
